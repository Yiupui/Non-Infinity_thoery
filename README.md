1. Is Infinity Really Infinite?

The word “infinity” has been with us since childhood.

In math class, we’re told numbers go on forever.

In science shows, the universe keeps expanding.

In philosophy, the soul is said to be eternal.

Even when we speak of “eternal love,” we are emotionally projecting the idea of infinity.

Infinity seems natural and everywhere.

But have you ever seriously asked yourself:
“Does infinity truly exist?”

Or… is it just a concept we use when we face things too big, too far, or too hard to understand?

When we can’t imagine what happened before the universe began, or what comes after it ends, we often just say, “It’s infinite.”

As if that ends the question — and makes it no longer our concern.

In this chapter, we’ll look at “infinity” again from different angles — everyday life, math, science, and philosophy.

The doubt toward infinity isn’t new. Even in ancient Greece, Aristotle already said there’s a difference between potential infinity and actual infinity. He believed actual infinity doesn’t exist in the real world — it’s only a logical idea.

In modern times, thinkers debated Cantor’s theory of infinite sets. Some “finitists” pushed back, saying infinity is only a math tool, not a real thing.

Even in Eastern thought, Laozi (Lao Tzu) said, “Reversal is the movement of the Dao,” which also points to cycles and limits.

Inspired by these ideas, I propose a new way of seeing reality — a theory I call Non-Infinity Theory — a fresh perspective on an ancient debate.1.1 The Illusion of Infinity in Daily Life: Cycles Can Fool Us

Imagine standing by the ocean, watching wave after wave roll onto the shore.

You might say, “The waves are infinite.”

But let’s look deeper:
Each wave has a beginning and end.
Waves are caused by wind and the moon’s gravity.
And one day, even the Earth will end — and the waves will stop.

We call it “infinite” because we’re only watching for a short time. We don’t see the full cycle.

So we assume it never ends.

We do the same with things like:
•   the changing seasons
•   the ticking of a clock
•   the spinning of the Earth

They seem to go on forever — but each cycle has a clear start and end. These endpoints reconnect to form loops.

That looping creates an illusion of infinity.

This is what I call the illusion of infinity in limited cycles.

Because our senses and time frames are limited, we easily mistake repeated or ongoing things as “infinite,” even though they are not.
1.2 Is the Universe Truly Infinite? Or Just Beyond Our Observation?

When we look up at the stars, we often ask:
“Does the universe have an edge?”

Some scientists say the universe is finite but without boundaries, like the surface of a sphere — limited in size, but with no edge to fall off.

Some theories say the universe may expand, then shrink back, in a big cosmic loop.

Even in the idea of an “ever-expanding universe,” scientists admit:
What we can see is limited.

Because the speed of light limits how much information can reach us.

So we return to a deeper question:
When we say “infinity,” are we just using a placeholder for “we don’t know where the edge is yet”?

That means “infinity” might just be a sign of our limits — not the universe’s.

This will be one of the key ideas repeated throughout this book.
1.3 What Is Non-Infinity Theory? A Difference Between Concept and Reality

Based on all this, I propose a simple idea:

Non-Infinity Theory

Everything in the universe, whether it looks cyclic or not, is finite.

“Infinity” is just a feeling or illusion caused by how limited our observation or thinking is.

This doesn’t mean the word “infinity” is useless.

It just means we need to redefine its role:
•   Infinity is a temporary guess we use when facing the unknown.
•   It’s a projection — a way to describe areas we haven’t reached yet.
•   It is a concept in our mind, not a real thing in the physical world.

So Non-Infinity Theory isn’t a final answer.

It’s an invitation — to question what we take for granted, and to rethink the difference between abstract ideas and actual reality.
1.4 What Games Can Teach Us: Complexity Isn’t Infinity

To help explain this better, let’s look at two common games.

[Example 1: Soccer – Looks Infinite, But Isn’t]

Imagine a professional soccer match.
22 players, 90 minutes, high speed action.
So many passes, goals, decisions.
From the outside, it seems like infinite possibilities — no two games are ever the same.

But is it really infinite?

Let’s break it down:
•   The field size is fixed.
•   The number of players is fixed.
•   Human bodies have limits.
•   The rules forbid many actions.

So actually, every second of play fits into a system with huge but countable combinations.

It’s very complex, but not truly infinite.

We feel it’s infinite only because it’s too big for us to track.

[Example 2: PAC-MAN – Simple Map, Countable Paths]

In the old game PAC-MAN:
•   The map is fixed.
•   You can only move up, down, left, or right.
•   The enemies move by preset rules.

You may feel there are many ways to play — eat pellets, run from ghosts, gain points.

But in truth, if we had enough time and power, we could list every possible path and outcome.

That’s not infinity — it’s limited paths in a complex system.

Now let’s zoom out.

Even a game like tic-tac-toe, which feels simple, has:
•   19,683 total board combinations
•   But only 5,478 valid endgames (if following the rules)

Players may feel free, but the system is still closed and countable.

This is the same message:
Even with free will and many choices, we don’t get true infinity — just many options inside a finite space.

Let’s return to soccer.

Now, doesn’t it look like a giant version of PAC-MAN?

•   The “map” is the field.
•   The “characters” are players.
•   The movement is limited by physics and rules.

It’s more complex than PAC-MAN, yes — but it’s still inside a framework.

We only think it’s infinite because it’s too much to calculate in real-time.

In the 1700s, people thought the universe had no end.

Now, science tells us: It might be finite but very large — and that’s different.

This is exactly what Non-Infinity Theory says:
Most things we call “infinite” are just complex finites that we can’t fully count.

This type of system is called a combinatorial explosion in math:
When a small number of variables creates a huge number of combinations.

The system blows up in complexity — but is still finite.1.5 The Truth About the Infinite Hotel: Potential Infinity vs. Actual Finiteness

The Classic Parable of Infinity: Hilbert’s Infinite Hotel

In math and philosophy, there’s a famous thought experiment called “Hilbert’s Infinite Hotel,” proposed by mathematician David Hilbert. It helps people understand how strange the idea of infinity in mathematics can be.

Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms: Room 1, Room 2, Room 3, and so on, forever. One day, a new guest arrives—but all the rooms are already full. Surprisingly, the hotel manager doesn’t turn the guest away. Instead, he asks each current guest to move to the next room:
•   Guest in Room 1 → Room 2
•   Guest in Room 2 → Room 3
•   Guest in Room 3 → Room 4
•   … and so on.

This shift leaves Room 1 empty, so the new guest can move in.

Now, let’s say not just one guest arrives, but an infinite number of new guests—an entire busload, endlessly long. Can the hotel still fit them all? Yes. The manager asks each existing guest to move to a room twice their current number (Room n → Room 2n), leaving all the odd-numbered rooms free for the new guests.

It sounds impossible, but mathematically, it works. This is the weird and wonderful nature of what we call “countable infinity.” It doesn’t match our everyday intuition, but it makes perfect logical sense.

2. The Challenge from a Non-Infinity View: Is the Hotel Really Infinite?

From a mathematical perspective, Hilbert’s Hotel is a flawless idea. But from a non-infinity viewpoint, it’s more like a mental illusion.

Imagine the hotel is built just three days before Earth is destroyed. Even if the hotel has “infinite rooms,” its actual time to function is limited. No one can ever use or explore all of those rooms. Once the hotel closes, its “infinity” ends with it. So when we say it has infinite rooms, what we really mean is that it has “potential infinity”—not something that can ever be fully experienced.

This type of infinity has no physical existence.  It’s a mental structure created by language and math. In reality, everything still depends on beginnings, endings, and limited time.

3. Misunderstanding Reality: The Power of Language

When we say “infinite rooms,” are we describing something that actually exists in space? Or are we simply talking about what’s possible in language?

Hilbert’s Hotel shows us the strength of language. We can say “Room 1, Room 2, Room 3…” forever, but we can’t actually walk to or reach all those rooms. Just like we can say π is a non-repeating infinite decimal, but we’ll never be able to write out all its digits. We “know” it’s infinite, but we can never “complete” that infinity.

This is very different from how we see the real universe. Galaxies may be countless, but they are still part of a limited, observable space. Time may feel endless, but we only live moment by moment. Hilbert’s Hotel is like a kaleidoscope of math: endless on paper, endless in the mind—but not endless in the real, physical world.

4. The Final Question: If Earth Ends Tomorrow, Does the Hotel Still Exist?

This question isn’t just about the hotel. It’s about infinity itself. If the hotel never has a chance to host an infinite number of guests because Earth ends too soon, then “infinite rooms” is just a potential idea, not a real thing.

From the non-infinity view, infinity is not something that exists—it’s a concept that might go on and on, but never gets completed.
1.6 Infinity in Mathematics: A Tool, Not a Thing

Mathematics is one of the first places where humans explored the idea of infinity. Questions like “If time and space can be divided forever, can movement even happen?” sound abstract, but they opened the door to thinking about infinity in philosophy and logic.

As math evolved, infinity became a powerful tool. Take this simple example:
1 ÷ 3 = 0.333…

That repeating 3 goes on forever. But does this number really “exist”? Mathematicians will tell you: the infinite 3s are not a thing that physically exists, but a way to express a concept. It’s not that there are “really” infinite 3s; it’s that the number is best shown this way.

Here’s another example:
π = 3.1415926535…

π never ends, and its digits never repeat. We’ve calculated trillions of digits—but there’s no point in space where those digits “exist.” They’re a result of logic and algorithms we use to describe the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. Infinity here is not a thing, but a method.

It’s like dividing a ruler forever. In reality, no one actually cuts a line into infinite pieces. All math is done in finite steps. Infinity isn’t something we can “reach”; it’s the process of getting closer to a certain point.
1.7 The Illusion of Infinity: The π Computer and the Cyclical Universe

We’ve talked about how “infinity” is often a label we use for things that feel too big or too complex to grasp. But is mathematical infinity something that can truly exist in the real universe? Or is it always limited by reality?

Let’s try a final thought experiment to explore how infinity might only ever be a useful illusion in a finite, cyclic universe.


Where Math Meets Reality

From school to university, we’re taught that math includes infinity. Numbers go on forever. Lines can stretch endlessly. π is infinite and non-repeating. In the world of pure math, these ideas are elegant and consistent.

But when we try to apply them to the physical world, problems arise. Everything in the universe—time, space, energy, matter—seems to have boundaries. The universe had a beginning (the Big Bang) and may one day have an end. Every event happens in limited time and space. Matter is made of finite particles. Can “infinity” from math really be part of this kind of universe?

It’s like a video game with a “limitless” world. In theory, you can keep exploring. But in reality, the game engine and your computer memory set limits. Could mathematical infinity be facing the same kind of limits?


The π Computer: A Test of Infinity

Let’s imagine an ultimate test. Right after the Big Bang, somewhere in the early universe, a perfect machine is created—a “π Computer.”

This machine is indestructible. It never runs out of energy. Its only task is to calculate the digits of π forever:
3.1415926535…

It saves all the digits it finds and never stops. This seems to be a perfect case of “potential infinity”—an endless process that never finishes.

It represents any process in the universe that seems to “go on forever.” But can it actually become infinite?


The Universe’s Answer: End and Restart

Now let’s bring in the idea at the heart of Non-Infinity Theory:
The universe is probably not a line that goes on forever. It’s more like a loop—a cycle with a beginning, middle, and end. After the cycle ends, the universe resets into a quiet, still state—“nothingness.” Later, this “nothing” might explode again into a new universe.

So what happens to our π Computer?
•   Time ends: No matter how powerful it is, the computer still depends on the universe to exist. When the universe resets, the machine, its energy, and all its data vanish.
•   Reset happens: The moment the universe loops back to “nothing,” the machine is erased. All the π digits it found are gone. It has to start over in the next cycle—if it ever comes back.


The Real Lesson: Infinity Isn’t a Thing

This shows us some deep truths:
•  Infinity can never be completed in real life: Even if a machine calculates π forever, it can’t ever reach “all the digits.” Because the universe itself is limited, the machine is too. Every cycle, it can only get to a large—but still finite—number of digits.
•  Potential infinity is always limited by actual finiteness: This is the key. A process might go on and on, but it will always be stopped by something bigger—like the universe restarting.
•  The universe defines all limits: No matter how powerful our tools or how big our math ideas, everything in the physical world is bound by the rules of this universe. If the universe itself is limited and cyclical, then nothing inside it can truly become infinite.


A New Understanding of Infinity

The π Computer shows us:
•   Infinity is a tool of the mind, not the universe: π and its endless digits are part of how we describe circles mathematically. It’s a great idea—but no machine, no matter how advanced, can ever “complete” it in a limited universe.
•   All processes must stop someday: Even if something looks infinite, it will end when the universe ends. That’s the heart of Non-Infinity Theory: Nothing lasts forever. Everything changes and repeats.

Even if we treat π as a purely mental idea—not a machine, but a thought—it still depends on the brain thinking it, and the universe that holds that brain. Once the universe ends, so does the thought. The “infinite idea” gets reset with everything else.

So when we talk about “infinity” again, we should stop treating it as a real, eternal thing. It’s not. It’s a useful projection of our minds—a process we imagine, but never finish. In a looping, finite universe, infinity is just a beautiful illusion we can never fully hold.

This doesn’t make math less powerful. In fact, it shows how amazing math is: it lets us imagine perfect things that the real world can’t contain. But like dreams aren’t reality, mathematical infinity might only be a tool of language—not a feature of nature.

For example, someone might ask, “Even if the universe resets, can’t the π Computer just keep going in the next cycle?” But in each reset, all data is lost. It’s like waking from a dream and forgetting it. No matter how many digits it calculated, they’re gone.

This isn’t a rejection of infinity—it’s an honest recognition of the limits of our minds and the universe we live in.
